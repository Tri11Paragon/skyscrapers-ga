Each of the boxes contains a skyscraper.
Put numbers 1 to 4 into the boxes which give the height of the building. The higher the number, the taller the skyscraper.
Each row and each column contains each number exactly once.
The number in an arrow shows you how many skyscrapers can be seen when looking in the direction of the arrow.
You cannot see a shorter skyscraper behind a taller one.
